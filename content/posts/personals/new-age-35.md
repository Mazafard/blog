Well, I've just turned 35. At this age, after making the biggest decision of my life—migrating—and the biggest career move of starting a company, which I haven't been successful in so far and has only brought me a lot of debt, I feel like there's still a long road ahead. I've discovered some cool information in a few new areas that I'll probably write more about here. Happy entering my 36th year!
